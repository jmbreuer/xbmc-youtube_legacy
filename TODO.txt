Default view for folders and video items defined in settings, and affected <-- cant do settings part without major change i xbmc
Related videos? <-- seems really pointless as a context item.. but hell i'll add it if someone asks
cm += [ ( __language__( 30500 ), "Container.Update(%s?title=%s&category='related'&page=1&vq=''&username=''&cat=''&orderby='relevance'&related=%s&issearch=False&update_listing=False)" % ( sys.argv[0], repr( __language__( 30968 ) ), repr( video[ "id" ][ "$t" ].split( "/" )[ -1 ] ), ), ) ]
Make find similar functionality (search from video title) work. (invalid handle shit)
